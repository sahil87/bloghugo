This is the first hugo blog post.

Crazy time trying to figure out differences sections, types and layouts. 

Finally the dust settles, with a few compromises.

##### TODOs:

- [ ] Need to add tags apart from just categories in the template. A nice challenge!
- [X] Need to figure out shortcodes for youtube and fontawesome. (About us page dependent on that)
- [X] To figure out how to publish to sahil.cc (to a separate github repo to allow https)
- [X] How are images used in hugo?
- [ ] Copy all posts

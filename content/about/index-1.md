I am a freak, an atheist, a thinker, a problem sniffer, a workaholic, a music nerd, a free software advocate,  a virus, a bathroom singer, a woman lover, a photographer, a chess player, an idiot, a clown, and alive.

I was born in 1987 at Ahmedabad, Gujrat (India). The part after that gets very confusing. So, I have organized the names of the places I have lived in (for myself):

Hello [Banagalore](http://wikimapia.org/#lat=12.9725675&amp;lon=77.6189715&amp;z=11&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2)!!!

Anshu came [here](http://wikimapia.org/#lat=12.9804922&amp;lon=77.6254088&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2) last week. We had a gr8 time!! He reached here last Saturday. We had an Italian brunch here at a great place named Casa Picolo on [CMH road](http://wikimapia.org/#lat=12.9784902&amp;lon=77.6290995&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2).

We asked Sriram where we could go. He told us about a great place to shop - [Brigade road](http://wikimapia.org/#lat=12.9731843&amp;lon=77.6068962&amp;z=17&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2). Me and Anshu first went to MG road and set about searching for his memory card. We found a great lane there to shop which joined [M.G. road](http://wikimapia.org/#lat=12.9725675&amp;lon=77.6189715&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2) at the middle from the left. We spent our time till the evening there going from shop to shop. From there, we went to meet one of Anshu's friend Kriti, at [Garuda mall](http://wikimapia.org/#lat=12.970064&amp;lon=77.609691&amp;z=17&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2). We took an auto to reach there. At Garuda mall, Anshu bought a few clothes for his interview. After that, she took us to Brigade road. We were walking that road, Anshu stopped suddenly and exclaimed, "I have come here before". We were on Brigade road the whole afternoon and we didn't know it!!. And we took an auto to Garuda mall, which was walking distance from there. I wonder which route he took us from. We went to cafe coffee day there, and them came back.

The next day, we went to a great place called [Marathalli](http://wikimapia.org/#lat=12.954626&amp;lon=77.6957953&amp;z=16&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2). It's a great place for shopping. I got 50% off on my Rebook shoes! And Anshu found the memory card he was searching for the whole day on M.G. the whole day but had found only duplicate, China made cards !

Next Wednesday my mom is coming, and so now am making a list of places to take her to, and yes, all the above mentioned place are there in the list.

And ya, forgot to mention, I spent the weekend before Anshu's visit in Google office in [K.R. Puram](http://wikimapia.org/#lat=12.994102&amp;lon=77.660943&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2), eating chocos and maggi, and playing pool and foosball.

This album basically summarizes what I did on that week's Firday (the 13th)  : [http://picasaweb.google.com/sahilahuja/ChennaiTripForVISAInterview](http://picasaweb.google.com/sahilahuja/ChennaiTripForVISAInterview)

Why it is the biggest mistake of your lifetime to go out with a member of the website development team of one of the most spectacular technical festivals in India..<br /><br />Springtime is here- a season of new beginnings, love, laughter and happiness. A great situation for budding relationships you may think. But will the blossom stand the frost of the web team lab of NIT Trichy. I can assure you that it is a trial by fire.<br /><br />This doesn't happen only to nerd types or programming fanatics, it can happen to anyone.. cos that s the kind of single minded devotion that Pragyan demands from all those who work for it.<br /><br />The guy I am dating is normal, that is, as far as guys g.. which isn't saying too much..:) but he seems to have gotten stuck in a sorta time warp.. with selective memory loss..<br />Imagine our stone age ancestors.. the times when shaving razors and bath soaps were out of fashion. Waiting in front of the campus main block for a couple of minutes can magically transport you back.. No prizes for guessing what my boy friend's selective amnesia includes..<br />For starters.. FOOD, HYGIENE, SLEEP and also  most importantly ME..<br /><br />A day in my life would illustrate this better..<br /><br />7:30 am Respective Hostels<br />ME: "Hey!! GET UP.. u r gonna be late.. 8:30 class.. anyway when did u sleep yesterday"<br />HIM:" I dunno.. three.. four.. " SILENCE<br />ME: " GET UP.. Don t go back to sleep"<br />HIM:"Watever...Yawwnn"<br /><br />8:30 am Class<br />ME: (SMS) " u get here now.. u cant bunk more than four classes"<br />HIM.. no reply.. dashes in when teacher is about to lock the door"<br /><br />12:10 pm<br />ME: "Lunch??"<br />HIM: " Oh.. sorry I have a meeting at one.. very important.. how about dinner... say sevenish, canteen?"<br />ME:"K.."<br /><br />7:15 pm Canteen<br />Me:(Thinking)" I 'll wait a while and then call"<br />7:30pm<br />Me: (Calling)<br />His phone:"Error in network connection"," number busy"<br />7:45 pm<br />Me: (SMS) U plan on coming or no..<br />try again to call<br />Finally.." The number you are trying to reach is currently switched off"<br />8:15 pm<br />HIM :"I am really sorry. Didnt mean to.. i was giving ppl work.. then jus wen i was coming out i met X.. I had to talk to him.. "<br />Phone rings..<br />HIM(on the phone):"Yeah tell me.. blaaah blaah blaah.."<br />Finally five minutes of peace.. we eat in silence.. then suddenly<br />HIM:"Server ke liye kuch karna padega"<br />Me:(THINKING) " Can he pls stop thinking abt work for a while.."<br /><br />10:00 pm<br />ON phone<br />HIM: "I am busy.. can i call u later??"<br />Me: "cool"<br />12:00 am<br />DITTO<br />1:00 am<br />ME:" U better sleep if you want to attend class tomorrow.."<br />4:00 am<br />HIM:" I am going to sleep now.."<br />ME:"HMMM.." doze off and put the phone down..<br /><br />and another brand new day with the same old routine begins..<br /><br />Well all relationships need a trial; we are serving our internships now.. And maybe it s all for a reason:)

Today is a great day!!

For the first time I was able to cross view. And only today I found out the type of stereograms I used to play with were parallel viewing. To find the difference between them go [here](http://phillips.personal.nccu.edu.tw/3d/3-D.html) or [here](http://www.angelfire.com/ca/erker/freeview.html). (Gosh! [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) articles for cross view and parallel view don't exist. I could create one someday!)

[Here](http://www.vision3d.com/methd04.html) is a great tutorial to get you started with crossviewing.

####  Normal viewing :

#### Parallel viewing :
Brain thinks image is farther.
In case of two adjacent images,

<pre>
L   R
|    |
L   R   -&gt; eyes, right eye sees right image, left eye sees left, and we overlap these two.
</pre>

#### Crossviewing :
Brain thinks image is nearer.
In case of two adjacent images,

<pre>
L   R

/\
L   R   -&gt; eyes, right eye sees left image, left eye sees right, and we overlap these two.

Everything there is to know about yaml condensed in a great blog post [here](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/introduction-to-yaml-creating-a-kubernetes-deployment/)

Also, I was facing an issue in Ubuntu of not being able to copy by Alt + Dragging objects. [This](https://askubuntu.com/a/883073/343628) post saved my day.

Pressing the Super (windows) key along with Alt while dragging items prevents the default window drag in Ubuntu.

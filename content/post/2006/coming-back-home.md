Now I am back home after what seems to be a very long  time. (During the last sem hols I was doing a project at IITB and could come home for only 2 weeks. The hols before that I had come for 2 weeks but those had gone by in training at ABB. So this is one time when i am <span style="font-style:italic;">really </span>home.)

One reason I am delibrately writing this blog is Hari's suggestion of writing blogs regularly.

I got the tickets for bengaluru today for the hpic conference. I also took the gre diagnostic test today -- it simply shook my feet. I got 1010 out of 1600 in the test. 310 in verbal and 700 in quantitative. That's ... bad. I havn't yet written my CV. Could cause me great deal of trouble later.

Today we formed an idea about how to proceed in the project. We planned on using queues as internal buffers for plotting the data. We also decided on running two threads in Java. One thread would handle the queue and the other would take care of plotting the values.

We also used the drawLine() function in Java for joining the points to make the graph look continuous. We studied threads more.

We realised that the 256MB RAM wasn't sufficient for our projec. We watched <span style="font-weight:bold;">Fanaa</span> in the night.

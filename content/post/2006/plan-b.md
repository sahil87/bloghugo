Today we went back to work. Mr. Pandit had told the professor that we had gone to Lamington Road to look for RAM in the torrential rain. We suggested a solution for solving the RDS network solver he had asked us.

We were facing problems in implementing the queues and they also were inefficient, so we decided to implement direct streaming of data from the database.

<span style="font-size:130%;">I was thinking of various ways of sharing stuff (movies, mp3's... you know.. the illegal kind) on our lan... </span>
And here is what I came up with :

1.  Use ftp - Create ftp servers, have a central site having the list of these servers.
2.  Use nothing - a revolutionary way of simply sharing through windows "share file" feature and setting up samba servers in linux.
3.  Use p2p file-sharing - by using one of the protocols listed [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-sharing_program#List_of_file_sharing_protocols).
Out of these...... I like the p2p file sharing method. Coz :

*   It's the right way to do it in a network like our's.
*   Yup. That's it.
Now.... read on only if you are interested (otherwise skip) or you will sleep.

Out of the listed protocols (from the site I linked to earlier) Gnutella, EDonkey and Direct Connect are the popular ones.
The most popular file sharing clients licensed under GPL for Gnutella is [LimeWire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limewire), for EDonkey it's [aMule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMule), and for Direct Connect it's [DC++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC%2B%2B).

DC++ has the "minimum amount of space needed to be shared in order to connect" feature... so we will use DC++. &gt;=)

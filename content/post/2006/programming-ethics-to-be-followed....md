It is high time that we at Octa start following standard programming practices.<br /><br />Two major steps to be followed this time during Pragyan coding are:<br /><ol><li>To develop pragyan using <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html">CVS.</a></li><li>To make use of the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/%7Edimitri/doxygen/">DOxygen</a> documentation system for automatic documentation and will develop our code in accordance with the DOxygen system.</li></ol>We will have to be absolutely sure that the above mentioned guidelines are followed before commencing any work.

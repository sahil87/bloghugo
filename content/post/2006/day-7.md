Today we got up at 9 in the morning and hurried without breakfast for fear that we were late. The lab was closed. We <span style="font-weight:bold;">successfully installed FC5 </span>on the computer by using the CD-ROM of another computer.

We also <span style="font-weight:bold;">installed the MySQL libraries for C and Java</span> and tested the code of the laptop on the PC. It was working fine.

We came to know that we were allowed <span style="font-weight:bold;">24-hours access to the department lab</span>  with AC. It had Windows and Linux. For surfing the internet, we have to ask for permission from <span style="font-weight:bold;">Prof T. S. Rathore.

We got a hostel room <span style="font-weight:bold;">H4-332</span> which was very dirty and without a tubelight. We asked for one more room.

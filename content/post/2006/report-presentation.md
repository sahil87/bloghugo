We had to give a presentation on our project to Prof. T. S. Rathore, about what we had achieved and what we planned to achieve further in our project. He saw everyone's presentations and didn't comment much on our presentation.

We also played with the C code introducing a sleep to reduce the processor load. The code took about <span style="font-weight:bold;">20s</span> instead of the usual <span style="font-weight:bold;">10s</span>. The reason for today's small blog is we spent yesterday night watching <span style="font-weight:bold;">Aladdin</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Swordfish</span>.

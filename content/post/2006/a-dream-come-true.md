I had always wanted to take photos since I was a child. This wish was fulfilled during these holidays.
I had gotten my mother a Sony DSC-W70 last time I had come for holidays after the IITB project. But that had been only for 2 weeks and I had barely gotten a day with the camera.
But this time..... things were different (with an evil smile). I got all the time I wanted with the camera. I played with it to my heart's content. Here are some of my shots :

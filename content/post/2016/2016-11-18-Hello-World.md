My very first post after a very very long haitus!

Too much has happened. It's overwhelming. 
The hope is with this blog sanity prevails the world becomes a happier place.

First things first :
1. Test the powers of [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and come up with a URL scheme
1. Import all previous blog (or at-leat point to them)
1. Ensure all DNS setting are properly set
1. Test if the blog works online
1. First write about why it took me so long to write a blog and how and why I am so thankful hexo exists

Of course - if you know me you know that 3 happens first!

No I am not going to write a tutorial for everything under the sun if it already exists.

Just recently found a great tutorial for Hexo - https://www.cgmartin.com/2016/01/03/getting-started-with-hexo-blog/

Useful info:
1. Use hexo-browsersync for live reload - was wondering how I didn't know about this earlier
1. Use drafts for writing posts and then publish. `hexo new draft "postName"`, `hexo pusblish "postName"`
1. Use `<!-- more -->` to show only the part above it listing pages and hide the rest in a "read more" button

      <description>While going over different technologies that could be used to augment the existing stack in GMETRI (more about that to be written) I came across a number of exciting advancements that occurred in the JS world over the last one and a half year. Focusing on creating a startup and with me becoming a father (for the first time) left me with little time to keep up with the latest tech happenings.</description>

      <description>My very first post after a very very long haitus!
Too much has happened. It&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming. The hope is with this blog sanity prevails the world becomes a happier place.
First things first :  Test the powers of Hexo and come up with a URL scheme Import all previous blog (or at-leat point to them) Ensure all DNS setting are properly set Test if the blog works online First write about why it took me so long to write a blog and how and why I am so thankful hexo exists  Of course - if you know me you know that 3 happens first!</description>

      <description>You have been warned. These are random thoughts.
After a lot of self evaluation, (or by asking a 5 year old kid), one realizes that the point of living is just being happy.
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, be happy!&amp;rdquo;  
But then, why us? Any one else could have been happy in our place.
One answer to this argument could be: Why bring about a change? You think you are special? Let the world be as it is.</description>

      <description>Their website sucks. [as on January 25th 2009].
And collecting information from different sources was NOT fun.
So here I am assimilating all steps at one place:
For routes: http://www.btis.in/airport# or http://www.flickr.com/photos/rednivaram/2541783270/ 
For timings: From airport to Bangalore, here&amp;rsquo;s the pic: http://www.flickr.com/photos/rednivaram/2540963595/ 
from Bangalore to airport, there&amp;rsquo;s no website. I called up Just Dial (080 23333333) and they mailed me this info:

      <description>Hi,
Its been really long since I blogged. Before going ahead, want to tell you that will be posting my endeavours on running virtual machines soon.
This, however, is my experience/guide for creating a super pen drive (a.k.a. a usb disk that if booted from presents a grub menu with options - GParted, Fedora, .. and any other linux distro hopefully, and has Fedora persistence, and has a spare partition too for you to use it as a normal pen drive).</description>

      <description>I have been bitten. And so I post this in the hope that some needy soul finds this before he/she/it gets bitten too.
Problem: Digikam saves image tags (ratings/captions that you spend hours editing) in its internal database. When you switch to a newer linux version, lose this information - unless you are careful enough to copy over the digikam.db4 file - which I was. The second problem is that if you move around or copy your files using a file browser, you lose this information ( !</description>

      <description>Giving httpd access to other folders (apart from default SElinux allowed folders):
 system-config-selinux rocks!! Go to System-&amp;gt; Administration -&amp;gt; SELinux Management (or system-config-selinux from command line). Type httpd in Filter and press enter. You will see that files that allow httpd write access have the Selinux File Type httpd_cache_t:s0. So.. now you know what to do right? Say you want to give httpd write access to folder /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cache, then add a new file labelling using the Add button with the following details: File specifications: /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cache(/.</description>

      <description>This is guide relevant to those who wish to spread fedora to friends and loved ones who don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always have an internet connection (or a good one atleast). The problem faced in such situations, almost always (talking from my experience), is that there are a huge number of rpms that need to be downloaded to make fedora capable of playing media, and fill it with good stuff like k3b, amarok etc.</description>

But I ll write about what&amp;rsquo;s on the top of my mind right now.
Yesterday (Diwali), Rajni aunty, mom&amp;rsquo;s friend, came to our house. Her son, (Mr. X we&amp;rsquo;ll call him) went straight to everyone&amp;rsquo;s feet wishing them Happy Diwali, conjuring a smile on everyone&amp;rsquo;s face as they blessed him (I know, a strange custom. Hopefully will be prevalent only for one more generation).</description>

Yesterday, he reached here at 9:55. After everything was brought in and kept at the wanted places, he gave me a feedback form. And boy, the first question was :

I mean, this is Faridabad.. in MAY!!! Last year this time, it was blazing hot with loo making it&amp;rsquo;s rounds all over India, with people dying of brain fever.
And now, when I come to Faridabad for 10 days, the last time before my job starts, the weather decides to become stormy, windy and rainy.
I caught a throat infection while coming home via Bhilai from NIT Trichy. I was hoping the heat here would cure the infection.</description>

It was a great journey form Trichy to here. Me and Ankit came together. We caught Rockfort express from Trichy and reached Chennai around 5:30 in the morning. Once we got down the train, we leisurely checked the time for our next train - Gareeb Rath. We had to go from Chennai Egmore station to Chennai Central station to catch the train.

It was the best trip of my life. We stayed there 3 days (3rd dec to 5th dec) in a guest house that Saurabh Shirolkar (a.k.a. Badri) had booked for us. We got a really nice deal. After that (5th dec) I went to my tayaji&amp;rsquo;s (Jayant Rai) house to stay there for 1 day. The next day on 6th dec, I left.</description>

      <description>Exposure refers to the amount of light falling onto the camera sensor. It is governed by two things :

The one feature the really struck me was the advanced search features. In digiKam you can create complicated search queries and can store the resulting photos as a group!</description>

      <description>I had always wanted to take photos since I was a child. This wish was fulfilled during these holidays. I had gotten my mother a Sony DSC-W70 last time I had come for holidays after the IITB project. But that had been only for 2 weeks and I had barely gotten a day with the camera. But this time&amp;hellip;.. things were different (with an evil smile). I got all the time I wanted with the camera.</description>

      <description>Today I discovered one of the coolest softwares to manage photos from a digicam! The software&amp;rsquo;s name is digiKam.
The thing I liked the most about the software is the date view and the album view.
I own a Sony W70. It has 2 modes of connecting to the computer (both use the USB connecting cable provided with the camera). One is the &amp;ldquo;USB Mass Storage mode&amp;rdquo; and the other is the &amp;ldquo;PTP/IP Camera&amp;rdquo; mode.</description>

      <description>Now I am back home after what seems to be a very long time. (During the last sem hols I was doing a project at IITB and could come home for only 2 weeks. The hols before that I had come for 2 weeks but those had gone by in training at ABB. So this is one time when i am really home.)
One reason I am delibrately writing this blog is Hari&amp;rsquo;s suggestion of writing blogs regularly.</description>

      <title>File Sharing on LAN</title>

      <guid>http://www.sahil.cc/post/2006/file-sharing-on-lan/</guid>
      <description>I was thinking of various ways of sharing stuff (movies, mp3&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; you know.. the illegal kind) on our lan&amp;hellip;  And here is what I came up with :
 Use ftp - Create ftp servers, have a central site having the list of these servers. Use nothing - a revolutionary way of simply sharing through windows &amp;ldquo;share file&amp;rdquo; feature and setting up samba servers in linux. Use p2p file-sharing - by using one of the protocols listed here.</description>

      <description>Look at this from Fedora FAQ - &amp;gt; Q:How do I reset my root password?  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; A: If you&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten your root password, and you want to change it, don&amp;rsquo;t worry! It&amp;rsquo;s possible. You need to boot into what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;single-user mode.&amp;rdquo; You must be in front of the computer to do this &amp;ndash; you can not do it remotely:  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; 1. Using the instructions in the runlevel question (under the &amp;ldquo;While You Are Booting the Computer&amp;rdquo; section), boot into runlevel 1.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s no nice guide for this!! So, I made one for myself. I own a Nokia N-Gage RH-29 (The one for Asia &amp;hellip; or something like that). Now, I refuse to use windows for seeing all my contacts on the computer. But for using the tool for linux (xgnokii) for Nokia phone doesn&amp;rsquo;t work right away for Nokia N-Gage.
Here is how to make it work -
 Install gnokii and xgnokii - &amp;ldquo;yum install gnokii xgnokii&amp;rdquo;.</description>

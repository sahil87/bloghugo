      <description>My very first post after a very very long haitus!
Too much has happened. It&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming. The hope is with this blog sanity prevails the world becomes a happier place.
First things first : 1. Test the powers of Hexo and come up with a URL scheme 1. Import all previous blog (or at-leat point to them) 1. Ensure all DNS setting are properly set 1. Test if the blog works online 1.</description>

      <title>The point of living</title>

      <guid>http://www.sahil.cc/post/2010/the-point-of-living/</guid>
      <description>You have been warned. These are random thoughts.
After a lot of self evaluation, (or by asking a 5 year old kid), one realizes that the point of living is just being happy.
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, be happy!&amp;rdquo;  
But then, why us? Any one else could have been happy in our place.
One answer to this argument could be: Why bring about a change? You think you are special? Let the world be as it is.</description>

      <description>Their website sucks. [as on January 25th 2009].
And collecting information from different sources was NOT fun.
So here I am assimilating all steps at one place:
For routes: http://www.btis.in/airport# or http://www.flickr.com/photos/rednivaram/2541783270/ 
For timings: From airport to Bangalore, here&amp;rsquo;s the pic: http://www.flickr.com/photos/rednivaram/2540963595/ 
from Bangalore to airport, there&amp;rsquo;s no website. I called up Just Dial (080 23333333) and they mailed me this info:

      <description>Hi,
Its been really long since I blogged. Before going ahead, want to tell you that will be posting my endeavours on running virtual machines soon.
This, however, is my experience/guide for creating a super pen drive (a.k.a. a usb disk that if booted from presents a grub menu with options - GParted, Fedora, .. and any other linux distro hopefully, and has Fedora persistence, and has a spare partition too for you to use it as a normal pen drive).</description>

      <description>I have been bitten. And so I post this in the hope that some needy soul finds this before he/she/it gets bitten too.
Problem: Digikam saves image tags (ratings/captions that you spend hours editing) in its internal database. When you switch to a newer linux version, lose this information - unless you are careful enough to copy over the digikam.db4 file - which I was. The second problem is that if you move around or copy your files using a file browser, you lose this information ( !</description>

      <description>Giving httpd access to other folders (apart from default SElinux allowed folders):
 system-config-selinux rocks!! Go to System-&amp;gt; Administration -&amp;gt; SELinux Management (or system-config-selinux from command line). Type httpd in Filter and press enter. You will see that files that allow httpd write access have the Selinux File Type httpd_cache_t:s0. So.. now you know what to do right? Say you want to give httpd write access to folder /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cache, then add a new file labelling using the Add button with the following details: File specifications: /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cache(/.</description>

      <title>Making Fedora rpms/yum work - Offline</title>

      <guid>http://www.sahil.cc/post/2009/making-fedora-work-offline/</guid>
      <description>This is guide relevant to those who wish to spread fedora to friends and loved ones who don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always have an internet connection (or a good one atleast). The problem faced in such situations, almost always (talking from my experience), is that there are a huge number of rpms that need to be downloaded to make fedora capable of playing media, and fill it with good stuff like k3b, amarok etc.</description>

      <description>So long since I have written anything. And there&amp;rsquo;s so much I want to write.
But I ll write about what&amp;rsquo;s on the top of my mind right now.
Yesterday (Diwali), Rajni aunty, mom&amp;rsquo;s friend, came to our house. Her son, (Mr. X we&amp;rsquo;ll call him) went straight to everyone&amp;rsquo;s feet wishing them Happy Diwali, conjuring a smile on everyone&amp;rsquo;s face as they blessed him (I know, a strange custom. Hopefully will be prevalent only for one more generation).</description>

Yesterday, he reached here at 9:55. After everything was brought in and kept at the wanted places, he gave me a feedback form. And boy, the first question was :
Were we on time?

      <description>Hello Banagalore!!!
Anshu came here last week. We had a gr8 time!! He reached here last Saturday. We had an Italian brunch here at a great place named Casa Picolo on CMH road.
We asked Sriram where we could go. He told us about a great place to shop - Brigade road. Me and Anshu first went to MG road and set about searching for his memory card. We found a great lane there to shop which joined M.</description>

      <description>And it rocks!!
The first thing you notice after fedora 9 is the blazing faaaast startup and shutdown times.
Now, before I say anything else about Fedora 9, here are a few screenshots :
Here&amp;rsquo;s Gnome in F9 :

And here is KDE 4 (finally !!):

KDE 4 seems to be following the footsteps of some of its latest applications like Basket. The new start menu now acts like that of IPOD.</description>

I mean, this is Faridabad.. in MAY!!! Last year this time, it was blazing hot with loo making it&amp;rsquo;s rounds all over India, with people dying of brain fever.
And now, when I come to Faridabad for 10 days, the last time before my job starts, the weather decides to become stormy, windy and rainy.
I caught a throat infection while coming home via Bhilai from NIT Trichy. I was hoping the heat here would cure the infection.</description>

Cheating wives are harder to come by. Wow. Nice article. Says men are more prone to infidelity (cheating on someone). Quite right.</description>

      <title>LDAP authentication through Apache for svn, trac or anything else for that matter :P</title>

      <description>Apache can be used as an access method for things like svn, trac, and even a whole file system through webdav. And apache also supports authentication through LDAP. Hence Apache can be used to authenticate the services that it provides through LDAP.
Here is how it is done :
For SVN :
&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt; ServerName repos.nitt.edu DocumentRoot &amp;quot;/var/www/svn/DocumentRoot/&amp;quot; ErrorLog logs/repos.nitt.edu-error_log CustomLog logs/repos.nitt.edu-access_log combined &amp;lt;Location /pragyan&amp;gt; DAV svn SVNPath /var/www/svn/pragyan &amp;lt;LimitExcept OPTIONS REPORTGET&amp;gt; AuthType Basic AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off AuthName &amp;quot;Pragyan SVN LDAP Authentication&amp;quot; AuthLDAPURL ldap://localhost:389/ou=Pragyan,dc=www,dc=nitt,dc=edu?</description>

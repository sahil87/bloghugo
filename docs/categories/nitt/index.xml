      <description>And it rocks!!
The first thing you notice after fedora 9 is the blazing faaaast startup and shutdown times.
Now, before I say anything else about Fedora 9, here are a few screenshots :

      <description>What Makes Married Men Want to Have Affairs? &amp;ndash; New York Magazine &amp;gt; Consider the Website meet2cheat, in which married people find one another for recreational sex; it charges $59 for a man’s three-month entry fee, $9 for a woman. Cheating wives are harder to come by. Wow. Nice article. Says men are more prone to infidelity (cheating on someone). Quite right.</description>

      <description>Here is a list of things I have done in the past three years. I have written for the sake of personal record.
As a member of Delta : Created a &amp;ldquo;PC Based Oscilloscope&amp;rdquo; in IIT Bombay, as a summer project. Used java servlets on the server side and a java applet on the client side. Was responsible for the whole of the software side - 2006 Summers Worked in Pragyan CMS V1, which finally got implemented in our college website - 2005-2007 Made Dalal Street, a stock market simulator using java servlets on the server side and using eclipse to make a java based ui compiled using gcj to eliminate the need of jvm to run the final executable - 2006 Dec - 2007 Jan Used CVS for the development of Dalal Street, understood the importance of a code versioning system.</description>

      <title>LDAP authentication through Apache for svn, trac or anything else for that matter :P</title>

      <description>Apache can be used as an access method for things like svn, trac, and even a whole file system through webdav. And apache also supports authentication through LDAP. Hence Apache can be used to authenticate the services that it provides through LDAP.
Here is how it is done :
For SVN :
&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt; ServerName repos.nitt.edu DocumentRoot &amp;quot;/var/www/svn/DocumentRoot/&amp;quot; ErrorLog logs/repos.nitt.edu-error_log CustomLog logs/repos.nitt.edu-access_log combined &amp;lt;Location /pragyan&amp;gt; DAV svn SVNPath /var/www/svn/pragyan &amp;lt;LimitExcept OPTIONS REPORTGET&amp;gt; AuthType Basic AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off AuthName &amp;quot;Pragyan SVN LDAP Authentication&amp;quot; AuthLDAPURL ldap://localhost:389/ou=Pragyan,dc=www,dc=nitt,dc=edu?</description>

      <description>Yup.
SVN IS MAD.
Sorry, SVN and HTTPD team up to drive people crazy.
I just came across two (or maybe three) of their misdoing in my effort to setup SVN on http://repos.nitt.edu
1) First, with this nitt.edu.conf in /etc/httpd/conf.d directory :
&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt; ServerName repos.nitt.edu DocumentRoot &amp;quot;/var/www/html&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; I got an error &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#ff0000;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;RA layer request failed svn: PROPFIND request failed on &#39;/pragyan&#39; svn: PROPFIND of &#39;/pragyan&#39;: 302 Found (http://repos.nitt.edu)&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  I found this article : http://ynniv.</description>

      <title>Creating your own schemas in FDS Ldap for use in postfix (or anything else for that matter) :P</title>

      <description>What I needed for mailman like functioning while making postfix work with ldap was an attribute that stores content of type DN (Distinguished Name) i.e. a node address, or holding a data type that stores nothing but data of type that can hold address of the data type itself.</description>

      <title>public_html web server - without mod_userdir</title>

      <guid>http://www.sahil.cc/post/2008/public-html-web-server-without-mod-userdir/</guid>
      <description>Hell, what does the title mean??
It means this :
Allow people to put files in the public_html folder in their home directories and allow it to be seen through the web server of that server in this format : http://servername/~username/hisorherfiles
Most people use mod_userdir to allow ~username directories in their webservers. However, there is simple rewrite rule workaround that eliminates the need for mod_userdir. I needed this because we had the home directories on the server, but the users had no login accounts on the server and they needed their public_html to work.</description>

      <guid>http://www.sahil.cc/post/2008/mail-with-postfix-and-ldap/</guid>
      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s possible. I did it for the pragyan.org server.
The setup we used was :
 /var/mail/virtual/%u: the inboxes of different users, /var/mail/virtual/PragyanMail/%u/%f: the different folders in mailboxes of different users.  It&amp;rsquo;s much easily setup than one thinks initially.
HOW?? Here&amp;rsquo;s how:
But, as with anything else, basics first
 SMTP server : Simple Mail Transfer Protocol : The server which sends and receives mails. Postfix (or smtp).</description>

      <description>I was asked by Piyush Mundhra to come up with a one-liner for my personlized Pragyan Core T-Shirt. These are the ones I liked :
Smile. It confuses People.
I am not BOSSY! I just have better ideas.
I don&amp;rsquo;t suffer from insanity. I enjoy every minute of it.
Has any of this time-saving technology ever let you go home one minute early?
The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from.</description>

      <description>Only yesterday I was having a discussion with Purnima on the way while escorting her to the station. How should you spend your life such that you have no regrets about it in your death bed?
I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out the answer for myself yet.
I tend to try to achieve as much as possible. But why?
A part of the answer is my thirst for knowledge, my unending desire to make sure things work and another part is, I fear, to make others look up to me.</description>

      <description>Having gone through the hell of installing an LDAP server once, I thought I could I could install the openldap server on the old server that we had to shift to.
Anshu had already broken his head on it and was at the verge of losing his sanity. And so i stepped in.
First I checked /etc/openldap/slapd.conf, line by line. Everything was fine. ldapadd -W -x -D &amp;quot;cn=Manager,dc=pragyan,dc=org&amp;quot; -f base.ldif **invalid credentials (49)**</description>

      <description>Sitting here in Morgan Stanley, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find free time. Things are always on the run.
But one day, I did find free time, and did what I had wanted to do for a very long time - learn about Normal forms in RDBMS.
Here is what I gathered from these websites :

Also, I was facing an issue in Ubuntu of not being able to copy by Alt + Dragging objects. This post saved my day.
Pressing the Super (windows) key along with Alt while dragging items prevents the default window drag in Ubuntu.</description>

      <title>UEFI Secureboot Hell</title>

      <guid>https://www.sahil.cc/post/2017/uefi-secureboot-hell/</guid>
      <description>Spent a really long time yesterday trying to figure out how to edit UEFI boot options after my old Intel Core 2 Duo desktop refused to boot up on intstalling LinuxMint 18.3.
Had to learn more than I had bargained for about the EFI FAT32 partition at /dev/sda1 to fix it. The efibootmgr command proved to be a lifesaver. And so did the script provided in this superuser.com post. May the person who wrote it live long and prosper.</description>

      <description>Always wondered if there is way in SELinux to disable the deadly rm -rf at / path.
Could never find the time to experiment in a VM to find out. Have you?
Oh, and the best thing about Hugo is that can now type blogs directly from the terminal =:D</description>

      <description>While going over different technologies that could be used to augment the existing stack in GMETRI (more about that to be written) I came across a number of exciting advancements that occurred in the JS world over the last one and a half year. Focusing on creating a startup and with me becoming a father (for the first time) left me with little time to keep up with the latest tech happenings.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I decided that &lt;code&gt;&amp;#96;&lt;/code&gt; was the best means to toggle Yakuake (which has been my lifeline for an integral part of the way I work for a long time now), typing &lt;code&gt;&amp;#96;&lt;/code&gt; whenever I needed it has been hell.

After going through a great deal and self doubt, the final outcome deserves being documented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A Rube Goldberg machine is a contraption, invention, device, or apparatus that is deliberately over-engineered to perform a simple task in a complicated fashion, generally including a chain reaction.                               Self Operating Napkin    My Convolution: To learn algorithms, I started a Coursera course, to run examples of which I needed a Java Project setup locally, in which I needed to input stuff, for which I needed a testing framework, hence I tried to find the best testing framework, and found out about Spock and also needed a project dependency manager like Maven/Ant/Gradle, and chose Gradle as the dependency manager of choice, and learnt Groovy to be able to write Gradle DSL.</description>

      <title>A Good Hexo Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://www.sahil.cc/post/2016/a-good-hexo-tutorial/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sahil.cc/post/2016/a-good-hexo-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;No I am not going to write a tutorial for everything under the sun if it already exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just recently found a great tutorial for Hexo - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cgmartin.com/2016/01/03/getting-started-with-hexo-blog/&#34;&gt;https://www.cgmartin.com/2016/01/03/getting-started-with-hexo-blog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful info:
1. Use hexo-browsersync for live reload - was wondering how I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this earlier
1. Use drafts for writing posts and then publish. &lt;code&gt;hexo new draft &amp;quot;postName&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hexo pusblish &amp;quot;postName&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;
1. Use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- more --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to show only the part above it listing pages and hide the rest in a &amp;ldquo;read more&amp;rdquo; button&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>My very first post after a very very long haitus!
Too much has happened. It&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming. The hope is with this blog sanity prevails the world becomes a happier place.
First things first :  Test the powers of Hexo and come up with a URL scheme Import all previous blog (or at-leat point to them) Ensure all DNS setting are properly set Test if the blog works online First write about why it took me so long to write a blog and how and why I am so thankful hexo exists  Of course - if you know me you know that 3 happens first!</description>

      <title>The point of living</title>

      <guid>https://www.sahil.cc/post/2010/the-point-of-living/</guid>
      <description>You have been warned. These are random thoughts.
After a lot of self evaluation, (or by asking a 5 year old kid), one realizes that the point of living is just being happy.
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, be happy!&amp;rdquo;  
But then, why us? Any one else could have been happy in our place.
One answer to this argument could be: Why bring about a change? You think you are special? Let the world be as it is.</description>

      <description>Their website sucks. [as on January 25th 2009].
And collecting information from different sources was NOT fun.
So here I am assimilating all steps at one place:
For routes: http://www.btis.in/airport# or http://www.flickr.com/photos/rednivaram/2541783270/ 
For timings: From airport to Bangalore, here&amp;rsquo;s the pic: http://www.flickr.com/photos/rednivaram/2540963595/ 
from Bangalore to airport, there&amp;rsquo;s no website. I called up Just Dial (080 23333333) and they mailed me this info:

      <description>Hi,
Its been really long since I blogged. Before going ahead, want to tell you that will be posting my endeavours on running virtual machines soon.
This, however, is my experience/guide for creating a super pen drive (a.k.a. a usb disk that if booted from presents a grub menu with options - GParted, Fedora, .. and any other linux distro hopefully, and has Fedora persistence, and has a spare partition too for you to use it as a normal pen drive).</description>

      <description>I have been bitten. And so I post this in the hope that some needy soul finds this before he/she/it gets bitten too.
Problem: Digikam saves image tags (ratings/captions that you spend hours editing) in its internal database. When you switch to a newer linux version, lose this information - unless you are careful enough to copy over the digikam.db4 file - which I was. The second problem is that if you move around or copy your files using a file browser, you lose this information ( !</description>

 system-config-selinux rocks!! Go to System-&amp;gt; Administration -&amp;gt; SELinux Management (or system-config-selinux from command line). Type httpd in Filter and press enter. You will see that files that allow httpd write access have the Selinux File Type httpd_cache_t:s0. So.. now you know what to do right? Say you want to give httpd write access to folder /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cache, then add a new file labelling using the Add button with the following details: File specifications: /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/cache(/.</description>

      <description>This is guide relevant to those who wish to spread fedora to friends and loved ones who don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always have an internet connection (or a good one atleast). The problem faced in such situations, almost always (talking from my experience), is that there are a huge number of rpms that need to be downloaded to make fedora capable of playing media, and fill it with good stuff like k3b, amarok etc.</description>

But I ll write about what&amp;rsquo;s on the top of my mind right now.
Yesterday (Diwali), Rajni aunty, mom&amp;rsquo;s friend, came to our house. Her son, (Mr. X we&amp;rsquo;ll call him) went straight to everyone&amp;rsquo;s feet wishing them Happy Diwali, conjuring a smile on everyone&amp;rsquo;s face as they blessed him (I know, a strange custom. Hopefully will be prevalent only for one more generation).</description>

Anshu came here last week. We had a gr8 time!! He reached here last Saturday. We had an Italian brunch here at a great place named Casa Picolo on CMH road.
We asked Sriram where we could go. He told us about a great place to shop - Brigade road. Me and Anshu first went to MG road and set about searching for his memory card. We found a great lane there to shop which joined M.</description>

I mean, this is Faridabad.. in MAY!!! Last year this time, it was blazing hot with loo making it&amp;rsquo;s rounds all over India, with people dying of brain fever.
And now, when I come to Faridabad for 10 days, the last time before my job starts, the weather decides to become stormy, windy and rainy.
I caught a throat infection while coming home via Bhilai from NIT Trichy. I was hoping the heat here would cure the infection.</description>

      <title>LDAP authentication through Apache for svn, trac or anything else for that matter :P</title>

      <description>Apache can be used as an access method for things like svn, trac, and even a whole file system through webdav. And apache also supports authentication through LDAP. Hence Apache can be used to authenticate the services that it provides through LDAP.
Here is how it is done :
For SVN :
&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt; ServerName repos.nitt.edu DocumentRoot &amp;quot;/var/www/svn/DocumentRoot/&amp;quot; ErrorLog logs/repos.nitt.edu-error_log CustomLog logs/repos.nitt.edu-access_log combined &amp;lt;Location /pragyan&amp;gt; DAV svn SVNPath /var/www/svn/pragyan &amp;lt;LimitExcept OPTIONS REPORTGET&amp;gt; AuthType Basic AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off AuthName &amp;quot;Pragyan SVN LDAP Authentication&amp;quot; AuthLDAPURL ldap://localhost:389/ou=Pragyan,dc=www,dc=nitt,dc=edu?</description>

Sorry, SVN and HTTPD team up to drive people crazy.
I just came across two (or maybe three) of their misdoing in my effort to setup SVN on http://repos.nitt.edu
1) First, with this nitt.edu.conf in /etc/httpd/conf.d directory :
&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt; ServerName repos.nitt.edu DocumentRoot &amp;quot;/var/www/html&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; I got an error &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#ff0000;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;RA layer request failed svn: PROPFIND request failed on &#39;/pragyan&#39; svn: PROPFIND of &#39;/pragyan&#39;: 302 Found (http://repos.nitt.edu)&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;  I found this article : http://ynniv.</description>

      <description>What I needed for mailman like functioning while making postfix work with ldap was an attribute that stores content of type DN (Distinguished Name) i.e. a node address, or holding a data type that stores nothing but data of type that can hold address of the data type itself.</description>

      <description>Hell, what does the title mean??
It means this :
Allow people to put files in the public_html folder in their home directories and allow it to be seen through the web server of that server in this format : http://servername/~username/hisorherfiles
Most people use mod_userdir to allow ~username directories in their webservers. However, there is simple rewrite rule workaround that eliminates the need for mod_userdir. I needed this because we had the home directories on the server, but the users had no login accounts on the server and they needed their public_html to work.</description>

      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s possible. I did it for the pragyan.org server.
The setup we used was :
 /var/mail/virtual/%u: the inboxes of different users, /var/mail/virtual/PragyanMail/%u/%f: the different folders in mailboxes of different users.  It&amp;rsquo;s much easily setup than one thinks initially.
HOW?? Here&amp;rsquo;s how:

I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out the answer for myself yet.
I tend to try to achieve as much as possible. But why?
A part of the answer is my thirst for knowledge, my unending desire to make sure things work and another part is, I fear, to make others look up to me.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a great day!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time I was able to cross view. And only today I found out the type of stereograms I used to play with were parallel viewing. To find the difference between them go &lt;a href=&#34;http://phillips.personal.nccu.edu.tw/3d/3-D.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.angelfire.com/ca/erker/freeview.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Gosh! &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/&#34;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; articles for cross view and parallel view don&amp;rsquo;t exist. I could create one someday!)

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vision3d.com/methd04.html&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a great tutorial to get you started with crossviewing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Sitting here in Morgan Stanley, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find free time. Things are always on the run.
But one day, I did find free time, and did what I had wanted to do for a very long time - learn about Normal forms in RDBMS.
Here is what I gathered from these websites :

      <description>Exposure refers to the amount of light falling onto the camera sensor. It is governed by two things :
                               High Exposure     The sensitivity of the medium the light is falling on (the ISO setting of your camers).</description>

The one feature the really struck me was the advanced search features. In digiKam you can create complicated search queries and can store the resulting photos as a group!</description>

      <description>I had always wanted to take photos since I was a child. This wish was fulfilled during these holidays. I had gotten my mother a Sony DSC-W70 last time I had come for holidays after the IITB project. But that had been only for 2 weeks and I had barely gotten a day with the camera. But this time&amp;hellip;.. things were different (with an evil smile). I got all the time I wanted with the camera.</description>

      <description>Today I discovered one of the coolest softwares to manage photos from a digicam! The software&amp;rsquo;s name is digiKam.
The thing I liked the most about the software is the date view and the album view.
I own a Sony W70. It has 2 modes of connecting to the computer (both use the USB connecting cable provided with the camera). One is the &amp;ldquo;USB Mass Storage mode&amp;rdquo; and the other is the &amp;ldquo;PTP/IP Camera&amp;rdquo; mode.</description>

The hols before that I had come for 2 weeks but those had gone by in training at ABB. So this is one time when i am really home.)
One reason I am delibrately writing this blog is Hari&amp;rsquo;s suggestion of writing blogs regularly.</description>

      <description>I was thinking of various ways of sharing stuff (movies, mp3&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; you know.. the illegal kind) on our lan&amp;hellip;  And here is what I came up with :
 Use ftp - Create ftp servers, have a central site having the list of these servers. Use nothing - a revolutionary way of simply sharing through windows &amp;ldquo;share file&amp;rdquo; feature and setting up samba servers in linux. Use p2p file-sharing - by using one of the protocols listed here.</description>

      <description>Look at this from Fedora FAQ - &amp;gt; Q:How do I reset my root password?  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; A: If you&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten your root password, and you want to change it, don&amp;rsquo;t worry! It&amp;rsquo;s possible. You need to boot into what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;single-user mode.&amp;rdquo; You must be in front of the computer to do this &amp;ndash; you can not do it remotely:  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; 1. Using the instructions in the runlevel question (under the &amp;ldquo;While You Are Booting the Computer&amp;rdquo; section), boot into runlevel 1.</description>

Now, I refuse to use windows for seeing all my contacts on the computer. But for using the tool for linux (xgnokii) for Nokia phone doesn&amp;rsquo;t work right away for Nokia N-Gage.
Here is how to make it work -
 Install gnokii and xgnokii - &amp;ldquo;yum install gnokii xgnokii&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>LGPL looked like the obvious choice for PCBO when the following problem cropped up - GPL Hijacking.
 LGPL doesn&amp;rsquo;t spread to other parts of an application and it does allow being linked with closed-source programs. LGPL is &amp;ldquo;compatible&amp;rdquo; with GPL in the sense that you can, at your option, convert a LGPLed program to a GPL one any time you want. Such a change is irreversible. For a small project, this is a risk.</description>

      <description>I was trying to decide which license to use for my PCBO.
So I had to do a bit of research on the usable licenses. These two sites were very helpful -
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ Basically GPL is like a virus. All derived and any larger work of which a GPL code is part of, must be open sourced and licensed under GPL.  But this imposes a lot of restriction on libraries like glibc which are used in almost every project.</description>

Two major steps to be followed this time during Pragyan coding are:
To develop pragyan using CVS.To make use of the DOxygen documentation system for automatic documentation and will develop our code in accordance with the DOxygen system.We will have to be absolutely sure that the above mentioned guidelines are followed before commencing any work.</description>

I found out IITs are not that much different from NITs.. Except the mess I dont find much difference in the work environment.</description>

There are many open source cms available but - none of them supports the amount of customizability we require. Our aim here is to make a website which will be used only in the course event. But the cms available are built for web-site management. We don&amp;rsquo;t want that. We want to host an event, that calls for rapid updates, browsing of online files, edited source code AND having a WYSIWYG editor at the same time, not to mention extensive support for features like quiz, report, user-management etc.</description>

      <description>Today we combined the front end design of the oscilloscope with the plotting program. We also integrated the slider and the volt/div controls. We also took 10^6 readings of an input waveform with varying frequency and voltages.
                                 Our report is expected to be only around 12 pages, so that made our job a lot easier.</description>

We discussed Op-amp networks and Schmitt triggers for almost an hour. He told us the pitiful state of education in engineering, the marks-oriented study condition, about how the teachers also were not so up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We also provided checkboxes for Pause, Trigger and Vector Mode.                                 We took a half day today.</description>

      <description>Today we started writing the project report. We started putting whatever we could find relevent in a document and planned to trim it off later. We planned the size of the report to about 35 pages.
We also discussed the front end of the applet.
Today Tushar came in the evening and Nitin spent the evening with him.</description>

      <description>Today was a big day. We achieved direct plotting of data from the MySQL database to the applet at a rate of about 4000 samples/s.                                 We calculated the frequency of the wave. As there was a mismatch in the speeds of Java and C, the displayed frequency was not correct but the code was working.</description>

      <description>Today we went back to work. Mr. Pandit had told the professor that we had gone to Lamington Road to look for RAM in the torrential rain. We suggested a solution for solving the RDS network solver he had asked us.
We were facing problems in implementing the queues and they also were inefficient, so we decided to implement direct streaming of data from the database.</description>

      <description>Today we formed an idea about how to proceed in the project. We planned on using queues as internal buffers for plotting the data. We also decided on running two threads in Java. One thread would handle the queue and the other would take care of plotting the values.
We also used the drawLine() function in Java for joining the points to make the graph look continuous. We studied threads more.</description>

      <description>We had to give a presentation on our project to Prof. T. S. Rathore, about what we had achieved and what we planned to achieve further in our project. He saw everyone&amp;rsquo;s presentations and didn&amp;rsquo;t comment much on our presentation.
We also played with the C code introducing a sleep to reduce the processor load. The code took about 20s instead of the usual 10s. The reason for today&amp;rsquo;s small blog is we spent yesterday night watching Aladdin and Swordfish.</description>

      <description>We realised the transfer of data through php and JavaScript made the process of plotting too slow, giving a plotting rate of only 1 frame/s. We had to take a different path, so we decided to use a Java Servlet. The applet was allowed to interact with the servlet through the sandbox. The servlet interacted with the MySQL databse. The implication of this was that we could achieve frame rates of upto 20 frames/s as the Tomcat server was fast.</description>

      <description>Guess what&amp;hellip; I am currently doing a project in IIT Bomabay. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it myself.
(And I googled out the topic PC Based Oscilloscope to select it. !!!!!!!!)
And we are even maintaining a blog on the project. Well&amp;hellip;. what can you say?</description>

      <description>Today&amp;hellip; For the first time we saw values change in the monitor with us changing a knob in our hands!!! (instantaneously) We plotted the graph of the actual and observed readings.. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!
We made a prog for querying C with MySQL and integrated it with PARAPIN.
Mr. Pandit told us to ponder more on the diode circuit problem he gave us.
Then.. I decided.. The following approaches are available for giving the data to the JAVA-APPLET:</description>

      <description>Today we successfully interfaced parallel port buffer through C.
We started the day late as usual.Vidyadhar Kamble, who was to give us lab equipments had gone on leave and was supposed to return on the next Monday. Then the lab was in hands of Vinod who was quite (damn) unhelpful and refused(!!!) to give us equipments till Vidyadhar returned. So, we went back to our lab and asked Mr. Pandit for help.</description>

      <description>Today is Sunday. We decided on Friday that we&amp;rsquo;ll be going to Pune.. We reached Pune at 11 P.M. by bus..
On Saturday.. We brought all our clothes to Pune to use Isli&amp;rsquo;s washing machine to wash our clothes. Turned out his washing machine hadn&amp;rsquo;t been used for 3 months :P . We spent an hour cleaning his washing machine. When Sahil washed his clothes in the washing machine.. and returned after 15 min, the water had turned darker than slum water.</description>

      <description>Today we were beaten up and looted. Well actually we broke the law. The day started with Sahil getting up late. Ladki finally aa gayi. We deposited our login forms. We then took our notebook and set off for Lamington Road to shop for an ADC with a list of 15 prospect ADC&amp;rsquo;s. Sahil wanted to recharge his mobile. Five buses left for Andheri in front of us. We then waited for an hour till we got a bus.</description>

      <description>Today we got up at 9 in the morning and hurried without breakfast for fear that we were late. The lab was closed. We successfully installed FC5 on the computer by using the CD-ROM of another computer.
We also installed the MySQL libraries for C and Java and tested the code of the laptop on the PC. It was working fine.
We came to know that we were allowed 24-hours access to the department lab with AC.</description>

      <description>Today we went to the lab and started work properly. We surfed the internet for two hours in the afternoon and searched for an appropriate ADC for our project, though we didn&amp;rsquo;t come to any satisfactory conclusion. We also collected the ID cards in the evening.
The day was cool but we didn&amp;rsquo;t do any work. We were sleepy in the afternoon. ladki bhaag gayi. We discussed about a diode resistor circuit solver in C in the evening.</description>

      <description>Today we successfully made JAVA query MySql!!!
At last&amp;hellip; Solanki Ma&amp;rsquo;am (the office person in the academic section) finally came back from her holiday (which delayed us by 10 days). We got the project form signed from the Dean which opened many doors for us -&amp;gt;
 We were able to pay the project fees (Rs. 2000/- each).
 The fees reciept enabled us to step inside the department lab.</description>

      <description>Today we interfaced C with MySQL successfully (even though we got up at 12 in the afternoon). We haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to contact Prof. T. S. Rathore and Mrs. Solanki was absent the whole week, due to which we are working in two teams, Sahil in H13 on Rohan&amp;rsquo;s comp and Sumit and me in H4 on my laptop. I had put the mysql.h file in /usr/include which was not the proper way of doing it, so Sahil downloaded the rpm from the internet and it worked like magic!</description>

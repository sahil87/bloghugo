      <description>This is the first hugo blog post.
Crazy time trying to figure out differences sections, types and layouts.
Finally the dust settles, with a few compromises.
TODOs Need to add tags apart from just categories in the template. A nice challenge! Need to figure out shortcodes for youtube and fontawesome. (About us page dependent on that) To figure out how to publish to sahil.cc (to a separate github repo to allow https) Using image in Hugo Deciding folder and URL structure of posts Finalize default archetype Copy all posts  Learnings Categorization: Categorization of posts in happen through two concepts:</description>

      <description>Ever since I decided that &amp;#96; was he best means to toggle Yakuake (which has been my lifeline for an integral part of the way I work for a long time now), typing &amp;#96; whenever I needed it has been hell.
After going through a great deal and self doubt, the final outcome deserves being documented.
The way to type a backtick without using the backtick key is through its unicode.</description>

      <title>public_html web server - without mod_userdir</title>

      <description>Hell, what does the title mean??
It means this :
Allow people to put files in the public_html folder in their home directories and allow it to be seen through the web server of that server in this format : http://servername/~username/hisorherfiles
Most people use mod_userdir to allow ~username directories in their webservers. However, there is simple rewrite rule workaround that eliminates the need for mod_userdir. I needed this because we had the home directories on the server, but the users had no login accounts on the server and they needed their public_html to work.</description>

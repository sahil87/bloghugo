      <description>I was trying to decide which license to use for my PCBO.
So I had to do a bit of research on the usable licenses. These two sites were very helpful -
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ Basically GPL is like a virus. All derived and any larger work of which a GPL code is part of, must be open sourced and licensed under GPL.  But this imposes a lot of restriction on libraries like glibc which are used in almost every project.</description>

      <description>Only yesterday I was having a discussion with Purnima on the way while escorting her to the station. How should you spend your life such that you have no regrets about it in your death bed?
I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out the answer for myself yet.
I tend to try to achieve as much as possible. But why?
A part of the answer is my thirst for knowledge, my unending desire to make sure things work and another part is, I fear, to make others look up to me.</description>

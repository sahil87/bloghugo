      <description>I just came back from Goa today morning.
It was the best trip of my life. We stayed there 3 days (3rd dec to 5th dec) in a guest house that Saurabh Shirolkar (a.k.a. Badri) had booked for us. We got a really nice deal. After that (5th dec) I went to my tayaji&amp;rsquo;s (Jayant Rai) house to stay there for 1 day. The next day on 6th dec, I left.</description>

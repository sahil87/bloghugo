We woke up early today. We added <span style="font-weight:bold;">sliders</span> for providing vertical and horizontal motion of the graph. We also added <span style="font-weight:bold;">radio buttons</span> for the time/div and volt/div options. We also provided checkboxes for <span style="font-weight:bold;">Pause</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Trigger</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Vector Mode</span>.

We took a half day today. Mr. Pandit also had to leave as he had to correct a mistake in the paper he had been setting. He had to set a paper on AIC (Analog Integrated Circuits) and had by mistake he set a paper on ADIC (Analog and Digital Integrated Circuits).

Today Saurabh and Nikhil came to visit us. We went to see <span style="font-weight:bold;">X-men 3</span> in the nearby multiplex. It was a good movie. Came back and watched The <span style="font-weight:bold;">Exorcism of Emily Rose</span> and had a debate over the horror movie. Slept late as usual. We also met Sandeep Sahare in the night.

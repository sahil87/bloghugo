Today we met the professor and decided to talk about the RAM and our leaving date. He was under the impression that we were final year students. That was why he had given us the RDS assignment. We corrected him immediately.

We discussed Op-amp networks and Schmitt triggers for almost an hour. He told us the pitiful state of education in engineering, the marks-oriented study condition, about how the teachers also were not so up-to-date.

We talked to him about the RAM on his unused PC and he consented. However, we found out that it was only 64MB and it would not help us in any way. We decided to run a part of our project on Nitin's laptop as the RAM was totally insufficient.

We improved the <span style="font-weight:bold;">slider</span> in the panel.

Sahil and Nitin watched Desperate Housewives till very late in the night.

The IIT B project here at IIT B turned out to be more work than play |=( .

Of course, I learnt loads of things - java tomcat server installation, java applet,  java servlet, got to know about online website development, made full use of [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/sahilahuja)  and a lot more...

I found out IITs are not that much different from NITs.. <span style="font-style:italic;">Except the mess </span>I dont find much difference in the work environment. Atleast in NITT, enthu towards work is the same. The professors here in IIT's are really dedicated. But then again that can be compensated for by studying more.
> What are books for?In a nutshell, <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-size:130%;">there is nothing here that can replace our good old OCTA :)

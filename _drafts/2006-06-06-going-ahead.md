Today was a big day. We achieved direct plotting of data from the MySQL database to the applet at a rate of about 4000 samples/s.

We calculated the frequency of the wave. As there was a mismatch in the speeds of Java and C, the displayed frequency was not correct but the code was working.

We also started designing the front of the oscilloscope.

Hemant visited us today.
